# SwapHotBar
a minecraft spigot plugin that change the relationship between the backpack and the hot bar, scroll rows' items in your backpack to your hot bar by simply pressing shift + mouse wheel

## [INTRODUCTION]

There are some mods (for example Quark) that allow players to switch between multiple hot bars.

SwapHotBar is a plugin that implement this feature in a simple way, by changing the relationship between hot bar and backpack: each row of player's backpack can be seen as a hot bar, when the player is in the game, pressing Shift + mouse wheel can scroll his/her items in the next row (or previous row) of backpack to hot bar for use, while the current hot bar's items will scroll back to backpack, that form a cycle. Therefore, players are able to give each row a purpose, and switch between rows easily.

This mechanism is very convenient in the game. The application scenarios include but are not limited to: switching weapons and tools, switching tons of building blocks, quickly searching for an item, etc.

Just see the following sample inventory and gif to understand the usage:
